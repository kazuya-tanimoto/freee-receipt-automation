# AI Context Optimization Guidelines

## Overview
This document explains methods for optimizing context to facilitate effective interaction with AI assistants.

## Context Provision Methods

### 1. Project Structure Sharing
- Project root directory structure
- Location and role of key files
- Dependency management methods
- Git submodule reference methods and update rules

### 2. Codebase Understanding
- Description of main components
- Architecture overview
- Important business logic explanation
- Coding standards reference methods
  - Naming conventions
  - File organization
  - Comment guidelines
  - Testing requirements

### 3. Development Environment Information
- Language and framework versions
- Development tool configurations
- Environment variables and configuration file locations
- Dependency package management methods

## Best Practices for Effective Interaction

### 1. Question Specification
- Specific problem or requirement explanation
- Clear definition of expected results
- Constraint presentation
- Explicit reference to relevant coding standards

### 2. Context Updates
- Appropriate information provision when changes occur
- Reference to related files and code
- Error message and log sharing
- Submodule update status

### 3. Feedback Provision
- Evaluation of proposed solutions
- Presentation of additional requirements or constraints
- Pointing out improvements
- Verification of coding standards compliance

## Important Notes
- Confidential information handling
- Code quality standards
- Security requirements
- Proper submodule referencing
