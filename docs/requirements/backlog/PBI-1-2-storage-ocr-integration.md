# PBI-1-2: Storage Integration and OCR Processing Implementation

## Description
Implement the storage system for receipt PDFs and integrate OCR processing capabilities to extract information from these documents. This includes setting up Supabase Storage, implementing the OCR processing pipeline using Google Cloud Vision API, and creating the data extraction logic.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Supabase Storage is configured for temporary storage of receipt PDFs
- Google Cloud Vision API integration is implemented for OCR processing
- PDF processing pipeline is created with the following capabilities:
  - PDF text extraction
  - Structured data extraction (date, amount, store name, items)
  - Custom processing for specific receipt formats (Apple, Amazon, etc.)
- Extracted data is stored in the appropriate database tables
- Error handling for failed OCR processing is implemented
- Processing status tracking is implemented
- Unit tests for OCR processing and data extraction are created
- Documentation for the OCR processing pipeline is created

## Dependencies
- PBI-1-1: Supabase Project Setup

## Estimate
8 story points (approximately 3-4 days)

## Priority
High - This is a core functionality required for receipt processing
