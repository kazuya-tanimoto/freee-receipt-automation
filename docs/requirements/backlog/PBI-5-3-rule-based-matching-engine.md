# PBI-5-3: Rule-based Matching Engine Implementation

## Description

Implement a comprehensive rule-based matching engine that applies generated rules
to improve receipt-to-transaction matching accuracy. This includes creating a rule execution framework,
rule prioritization system, and integration with the existing matching pipeline.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Rule execution framework is implemented:
  - Rule parsing and interpretation
  - Efficient rule application
  - Rule chaining and dependencies
  - Rule execution logging
- Rule prioritization system is implemented:
  - Rule scoring based on confidence and frequency
  - Rule ordering and execution sequence
  - Conflict resolution between competing rules
  - Dynamic rule prioritization based on performance
- Integration with matching pipeline is completed:
  - Pre-matching rule application
  - Post-matching rule application
  - Rule-based match refinement
  - Rule-based match validation
- Performance optimization is implemented:
  - Caching of frequently used rules
  - Indexing for rule lookup
  - Batch rule application
- Rule effectiveness metrics are implemented
- A/B testing framework for rule engine improvements
- Matching accuracy improvement of at least 25% compared to basic algorithm
- Unit tests for rule-based matching engine are created
- Documentation for the rule-based matching engine is created

## Dependencies

- PBI-5-2: Automatic Rule Generation
- PBI-4-3: Basic Matching Algorithm Refinement

## Estimate

8 story points (approximately 3-4 days)

## Priority

Low - Advanced feature that depends on rule generation
