# PBI-4-2: OCR Accuracy Improvement

## Description
Enhance the OCR processing system to improve the accuracy of text extraction and data recognition from receipt PDFs. This includes implementing pre-processing techniques, optimizing OCR parameters, and creating specialized handlers for common receipt formats.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Image pre-processing techniques are implemented:
  - Image enhancement (contrast, brightness adjustment)
  - Noise reduction
  - Rotation correction
  - Perspective correction
- OCR parameter optimization is implemented:
  - Language settings optimization
  - Recognition mode configuration
  - Confidence threshold tuning
- Specialized receipt format handlers are created for:
  - Amazon receipts
  - Apple receipts
  - Rakuten receipts
  - Common subscription services
  - Gas station receipts
- Post-processing techniques are implemented:
  - Text normalization
  - Error correction
  - Format standardization
- OCR accuracy metrics and monitoring are implemented
- A/B testing framework for OCR improvements is created
- Accuracy improvement of at least 15% compared to baseline
- Unit tests for OCR improvements are created
- Documentation for the OCR accuracy improvements is created

## Dependencies
- PBI-1-2: Storage Integration and OCR Processing

## Estimate
8 story points (approximately 3-4 days)

## Priority
Medium - Important for system reliability but builds on existing functionality
