  - Handle various receipt email formats (Apple, subscription services, etc.)
- Extracted receipts are passed to the OCR processing pipeline
- Processing status tracking for email receipts is implemented
- Error handling for Gmail API failures is implemented
- Unit tests for Gmail API integration are created
- Documentation for the Gmail API integration is created

## Dependencies

- PBI-1-1: Supabase Project Setup
