# PBI-5-2: Automatic Rule Generation from Correction History

## Description
Implement a system to automatically generate matching rules based on user correction data. This includes creating rule generation algorithms, rule validation mechanisms, and a rule management system to improve the matching process over time.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Rule generation algorithms are implemented:
  - Pattern recognition from correction data
  - Frequency-based rule prioritization
  - Confidence scoring for generated rules
  - Conflict resolution for contradictory rules
- Rule types are implemented:
  - Vendor-to-category mapping rules
  - Keyword-to-category mapping rules
  - Date adjustment rules
  - Amount tolerance rules
  - Special case handling rules
- Rule validation system is implemented:
  - Testing rules against historical data
  - Performance metrics for rule effectiveness
  - Automatic rule refinement based on results
- Rule management interface is created:
  - View and edit generated rules
  - Enable/disable specific rules
  - Manually create custom rules
  - Rule version history
- Rule application system is implemented
- Periodic rule generation and refinement process
- Unit tests for rule generation features are created
- Documentation for the rule generation system is created

## Dependencies
- PBI-5-1: User Correction Data Collection
- PBI-4-3: Basic Matching Algorithm Refinement

## Estimate
8 story points (approximately 3-4 days)

## Priority
Low - Advanced feature that depends on data collection
