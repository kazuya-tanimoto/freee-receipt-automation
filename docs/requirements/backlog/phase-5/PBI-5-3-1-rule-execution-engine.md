# PBI-5-3-1: Rule Execution Engine

## Description

Implement a rule execution engine that can parse, interpret, and apply matching rules
to receipt-transaction pairs. This includes rule parsing, execution framework, and
logging capabilities.

## Implementation Details

### Files to Create/Modify

1. `src/lib/rules/execution-engine.ts` - Core rule execution engine
2. `src/lib/rules/rule-parser.ts` - Rule parsing and interpretation
3. `src/lib/rules/rule-executor.ts` - Individual rule execution logic
4. `src/types/rule-execution.ts` - Execution types and interfaces
5. `src/lib/rules/__tests__/execution-engine.test.ts` - Unit tests
6. `src/lib/rules/execution-logger.ts` - Rule execution logging

### Technical Requirements

- Parse different rule types (vendor, keyword, amount, date)
- Execute rules with proper error handling
- Support rule chaining and dependencies
- Log execution results for debugging
- Implement execution timeouts and limits

### Engine Architecture

```typescript
interface RuleExecutionEngine {
  executeRule(
    rule: MatchingRule,
    context: ExecutionContext,
  ): Promise<RuleResult>;
  executeRuleSet(
    rules: MatchingRule[],
    context: ExecutionContext,
  ): Promise<RuleSetResult>;
  parseRule(rule: MatchingRule): ParsedRule;
  validateRule(rule: MatchingRule): ValidationResult;
}

interface ExecutionContext {
  receipt: Receipt;
  transactions: Transaction[];
  userId: string;
  timestamp: Date;
}

interface RuleResult {
  ruleId: string;
  success: boolean;
  confidence: number;
  matches: MatchCandidate[];
  executionTime: number;
  error?: string;
}
```

### Rule Types Support

```typescript
interface ParsedRule {
  id: string;
  type: RuleType;
  conditions: RuleCondition[];
  actions: RuleAction[];
  metadata: RuleMetadata;
}

interface RuleCondition {
  field: string;
  operator: ConditionOperator;
  value: any;
  weight?: number;
}

type ConditionOperator =
  | "equals"
  | "contains"
  | "startsWith"
  | "endsWith"
  | "between"
  | "fuzzyMatch";
```

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Parse and validate all rule types
- [ ] Execute rules with proper error handling
- [ ] Support rule chaining and dependencies
- [ ] Log execution results and performance metrics
- [ ] Handle rule timeouts and resource limits
- [ ] Provide detailed execution results

## Dependencies

- **Required**: PBI-5-2-2 (Rule Generation System)
- **Required**: PBI-4-3-1 (Advanced Matching Techniques)

## Testing Requirements

- Unit tests: Rule parsing and execution logic
- Integration tests: Rule execution with real data
- Performance tests: Execution speed and resource usage

## Estimate

2 story points

## Priority

High - Core engine for rule-based matching

## Implementation Notes

- Use async/await for non-blocking execution
- Implement circuit breakers for rule failures
- Consider rule execution caching for performance
