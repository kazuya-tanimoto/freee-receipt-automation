## Rule Governance and Lifecycle Management

### Rule Lifecycle

```typescript
interface RuleLifecycle {
  createdAt: Date;
  lastUsedAt: Date;
  effectivenessScore: number; // 0-100
  autoExpireAfterDays: number; // Default: 90 days
  requiresReview: boolean;
  usageCount: number;
  maxRulesPerUser: number; // Default: 100
}
```

### Governance Policies

**Automatic Rule Management**:
- Rules unused for 90+ days are automatically deactivated
- Rules with effectiveness score < 30% are flagged for review
- Maximum 100 active rules per user to maintain performance
- Weekly rule performance evaluation and cleanup

**Quality Control**:
- Minimum 5 corrections required for rule generation
- Statistical significance test (p-value < 0.05) for rule validation
- A/B testing for rule effectiveness measurement
- Conflict detection and resolution between contradictory rules

**Monitoring and Alerts**:
- Real-time rule execution monitoring
- Performance degradation alerts (>100ms execution time)
- Anomaly detection for unusual rule behavior
- Dashboard for rule effectiveness tracking

### Risk Mitigation

**Technical Risks**:
- Insufficient data: Graceful degradation to basic matching
- Rule conflicts: Automated conflict resolution with user override
- Performance impact: Circuit breakers and execution timeouts
- Data quality: Input validation and sanitization

**Business Risks**:
- Over-reliance on rules: Maintain fallback to basic algorithms
- User confusion: Clear rule explanations and reasoning
- Privacy concerns: Data anonymization and retention policies

## Technical Notes

- Comprehensive TypeScript typing and testing requirements
- Security-first approach with RLS policies and data encryption
- Performance optimization with caching and batch processing
- Statistical rigor in rule generation and effectiveness measurement
