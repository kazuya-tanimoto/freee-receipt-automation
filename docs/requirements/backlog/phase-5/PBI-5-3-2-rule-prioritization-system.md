# PBI-5-3-2: Rule Prioritization and Ordering System

## Description

Implement dynamic rule prioritization system that orders rule execution based on
confidence scores, performance history, specificity, and context relevance.
This ensures optimal rule application sequence for maximum matching accuracy.

## Implementation Details

### Files to Create/Modify

1. `src/lib/rules/rule-prioritizer.ts` - Rule prioritization logic
2. `src/lib/rules/priority-calculator.ts` - Priority score calculation
3. `src/lib/rules/context-analyzer.ts` - Context relevance analysis
4. `src/types/prioritization.ts` - Prioritization type definitions
5. `src/lib/rules/__tests__/rule-prioritizer.test.ts` - Unit tests

### Technical Requirements

- Dynamic rule ordering based on multiple factors
- Context-aware prioritization (receipt type, amount, vendor)
- Performance-based priority adjustments
- Rule specificity scoring and ordering
- Support for manual priority overrides

### Prioritization Architecture

```typescript
interface RulePrioritizer {
  prioritizeRules(rules: MatchingRule[], context: PrioritizationContext): PrioritizedRule[];
  calculatePriority(rule: MatchingRule, context: PrioritizationContext): PriorityScore;
  updatePrioritiesFromPerformance(rulePerformance: RulePerformance[]): Promise<void>;
  getOptimalExecutionOrder(rules: MatchingRule[], context: PrioritizationContext): string[];
}

interface PrioritizedRule extends MatchingRule {
  priority: PriorityScore;
  executionOrder: number;
  reasoning: string[];
}

interface PriorityScore {
  overall: number; // 0-100
  factors: PriorityFactor[];
  confidence: number;
  specificity: number;
  performance: number;
  contextRelevance: number;
}
```

### Priority Factors

```typescript
interface PrioritizationContext {
  receipt: Receipt;
  candidateTransactions: Transaction[];
  userId: string;
  historicalPerformance: Record<string, RulePerformance>;
  currentTime: Date;
}

interface PriorityFactor {
  name: string;
  score: number;
  weight: number;
  description: string;
}

interface ContextRelevance {
  receiptTypeMatch: number;
  amountRangeMatch: number;
  vendorTypeMatch: number;
  temporalRelevance: number;
  userPreferenceMatch: number;
}
```

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Calculate dynamic priority scores for rules
- [ ] Order rules based on context relevance
- [ ] Adjust priorities based on performance history
- [ ] Support manual priority overrides
- [ ] Provide priority reasoning and explanations
- [ ] Optimize execution order for efficiency

## Dependencies

- **Required**: PBI-5-3-1 (Rule Execution Engine)
- **Required**: PBI-5-2-5 (Rule Confidence Scoring)

## Testing Requirements

- Unit tests: Priority calculation algorithms
- Integration tests: Rule ordering with various contexts
- Performance tests: Prioritization speed with large rule sets

## Estimate

## Priority

High - Critical for optimal rule performance

## Implementation Notes

- Use weighted scoring for priority factors
- Implement priority caching for performance
- Consider machine learning for priority optimization
