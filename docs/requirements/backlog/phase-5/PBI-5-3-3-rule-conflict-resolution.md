# PBI-5-3-3: Rule Conflict Detection and Resolution

## Description

Implement system to detect and resolve conflicts between matching rules, handling
contradictory rules, overlapping conditions, and competing matches. This ensures
consistent and predictable rule behavior in complex scenarios.

## Implementation Details

### Files to Create/Modify

1. `src/lib/rules/conflict-detector.ts` - Rule conflict detection logic
2. `src/lib/rules/conflict-resolver.ts` - Conflict resolution strategies
3. `src/lib/rules/rule-compatibility.ts` - Rule compatibility analysis
4. `src/types/conflicts.ts` - Conflict type definitions
5. `src/lib/rules/__tests__/conflict-resolution.test.ts` - Unit tests

### Technical Requirements

- Detect various types of rule conflicts
- Implement multiple conflict resolution strategies
- Support user-defined conflict resolution preferences
- Track and log conflict resolution decisions
- Provide conflict analysis and recommendations

### Conflict Detection Architecture

```typescript
interface ConflictDetector {
  detectConflicts(rules: MatchingRule[]): RuleConflict[];
  analyzeRuleCompatibility(rule1: MatchingRule, rule2: MatchingRule): CompatibilityAnalysis;
  findOverlappingRules(rules: MatchingRule[]): RuleOverlap[];
  detectContradictoryRules(rules: MatchingRule[]): ContradictoryRule[];
}

interface RuleConflict {
  id: string;
  type: ConflictType;
  conflictingRules: string[];
  severity: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high';
  description: string;
  examples: ConflictExample[];
  resolutionSuggestions: ResolutionSuggestion[];
}

type ConflictType = 'contradiction' | 'overlap' | 'circular_dependency' | 'mutual_exclusion';
```

### Conflict Resolution

```typescript
interface ConflictResolver {
  resolveConflict(conflict: RuleConflict, strategy: ResolutionStrategy): ConflictResolution;
  getAvailableStrategies(conflict: RuleConflict): ResolutionStrategy[];
  applyResolution(resolution: ConflictResolution): Promise<void>;
  validateResolution(resolution: ConflictResolution): ValidationResult;
}

interface ResolutionStrategy {
  name: string;
  description: string;
  applicableConflicts: ConflictType[];
  priority: number;
  userConfigurable: boolean;
}

interface ConflictResolution {
  conflictId: string;
  strategy: ResolutionStrategy;
  actions: ResolutionAction[];
  impact: ResolutionImpact;
  reasoning: string;
}
```

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Detect all types of rule conflicts automatically
- [ ] Provide multiple resolution strategies per conflict
- [ ] Support user preferences for conflict resolution
- [ ] Log all conflict resolutions for audit
- [ ] Validate resolution effectiveness
- [ ] Provide conflict prevention recommendations

## Dependencies

- **Required**: PBI-5-3-2 (Rule Prioritization System)
- **Required**: PBI-5-2-6 (Rule Validation System)

## Testing Requirements

- Unit tests: Conflict detection and resolution logic
- Integration tests: Complex conflict scenarios
- Test data: Various rule configurations with known conflicts

## Estimate

1 story point

## Priority

High - Ensures rule system reliability

## Implementation Notes

- Implement graph-based conflict detection
- Use decision trees for resolution strategies
- Provide user override capabilities
