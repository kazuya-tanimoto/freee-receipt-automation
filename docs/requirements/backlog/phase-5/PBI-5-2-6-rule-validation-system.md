# PBI-5-2-6: Rule Validation and Testing System

## Description

Implement comprehensive rule validation system that tests generated rules against
historical data, validates rule logic, and ensures rule quality before activation.
This prevents poor-performing rules from affecting matching accuracy.

## Implementation Details

### Files to Create/Modify

1. `src/lib/rules/rule-validator.ts` - Core rule validation logic
2. `src/lib/rules/historical-tester.ts` - Historical data testing
3. `src/lib/rules/rule-quality-checker.ts` - Rule quality assessment
4. `src/types/validation.ts` - Validation result types
5. `src/lib/rules/__tests__/rule-validator.test.ts` - Unit tests

### Technical Requirements

- Validate rule syntax and logical consistency
- Test rules against historical correction data
- Calculate rule accuracy and performance metrics
- Implement cross-validation for rule effectiveness
- Support A/B testing framework for rule comparison

### Validation Architecture

```typescript
interface RuleValidator {
  validateRule(rule: MatchingRule): ValidationResult;
  testAgainstHistory(
    rule: MatchingRule,
    testData: TestDataset,
  ): HistoricalTestResult;
  assessRuleQuality(rule: MatchingRule): QualityAssessment;
  performCrossValidation(
    rule: MatchingRule,
    folds: number,
  ): CrossValidationResult;
}

interface ValidationResult {
  isValid: boolean;
  errors: ValidationError[];
  warnings: ValidationWarning[];
  recommendations: string[];
  qualityScore: number;
}

interface HistoricalTestResult {
  accuracy: number;
  precision: number;
  recall: number;
  f1Score: number;
  truePositives: number;
  falsePositives: number;
  falseNegatives: number;
  testCases: TestCase[];
}
```

### Quality Assessment

```typescript
interface QualityAssessment {
  overallScore: number;
  metrics: QualityMetric[];
  riskFactors: RiskFactor[];
  recommendations: QualityRecommendation[];
}

interface QualityMetric {
  name: string;
  score: number;
  threshold: number;
  status: "pass" | "warn" | "fail";
}

interface CrossValidationResult {
  averageAccuracy: number;
  standardDeviation: number;
  foldResults: FoldResult[];
  isReliable: boolean;
}
```

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Validate rule syntax and logical consistency
- [ ] Test rules against historical data with metrics
- [ ] Assess rule quality with comprehensive scoring
- [ ] Perform cross-validation for reliability testing
- [ ] Provide detailed validation reports
- [ ] Support automated rule approval/rejection

## Dependencies

- **Required**: PBI-5-2-5 (Rule Confidence Scoring)
- **Required**: PBI-5-1-2 (Correction Data Collection API)

## Testing Requirements

- Unit tests: Validation logic and quality assessment
- Integration tests: Historical testing with real data
- Test data: Diverse rule types and historical scenarios

## Estimate

1 story point

## Priority

High - Ensures rule quality and system reliability

## Implementation Notes

- Use stratified sampling for historical testing
- Implement automated quality thresholds
- Consider ensemble validation methods
