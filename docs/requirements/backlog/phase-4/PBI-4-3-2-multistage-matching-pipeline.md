# PBI-4-3-2: Multi-stage Matching Pipeline

## Description

Create sophisticated multi-stage matching pipeline with primary exact matching, secondary fuzzy matching,
and fallback matching for edge cases with configurable stages and confidence thresholds.

## Implementation Details

### Technical Requirements

- Primary matching based on exact criteria (amount, date, vendor)
- Secondary matching based on fuzzy criteria with tolerance
- Fallback matching for edge cases and partial matches
- Configurable stage thresholds and weights
- Pipeline optimization for performance
- Stage-specific confidence scoring

### Multi-stage Pipeline Architecture

```typescript
interface MatchingStage {
  name: string;
  criteria: MatchingCriteria[];
  threshold: number;
  weight: number;
  enabled: boolean;
}

interface MatchingPipeline {
  stages: MatchingStage[];
  execute(
    receipt: Receipt,
    transactions: Transaction[],
  ): Promise<MatchingResult[]>;
  optimizeStages(
    performanceData: PerformanceMetric[],
  ): Promise<MatchingStage[]>;
}
```
