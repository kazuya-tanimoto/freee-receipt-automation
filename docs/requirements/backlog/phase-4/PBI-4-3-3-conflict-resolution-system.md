# PBI-4-3-3: Matching Conflict Resolution System

## Description

Implement intelligent conflict resolution system to handle multiple receipt candidates for transactions,
multiple transaction candidates for receipts, and ambiguous matches with prioritization rules.

## Implementation Details

### Technical Requirements

- Handling multiple receipt candidates for a single transaction
- Handling multiple transaction candidates for a single receipt
- Prioritization rules for ambiguous matches
- Confidence-based conflict resolution
- User feedback integration for learning
- Automated conflict resolution with manual override

### Conflict Resolution Architecture

```typescript
interface MatchingConflict {
  type: "multiple_receipts" | "multiple_transactions" | "ambiguous_match";
  confidence: number;
  candidates: MatchCandidate[];
  resolution: ConflictResolution;
}

interface ConflictResolver {
  detectConflicts(matches: MatchingResult[]): Promise<MatchingConflict[]>;
  resolveConflict(conflict: MatchingConflict): Promise<ConflictResolution>;
  applyResolution(resolution: ConflictResolution): Promise<boolean>;
}
```
