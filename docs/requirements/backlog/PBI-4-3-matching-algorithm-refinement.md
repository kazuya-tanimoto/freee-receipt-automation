# PBI-4-3: Basic Matching Algorithm Refinement

## Description

Refine the basic matching algorithm to improve the accuracy and reliability of receipt-to-transaction matching.
This includes implementing advanced matching techniques, optimizing matching parameters,
and creating a more robust matching pipeline.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Advanced matching techniques are implemented:
  - Fuzzy date matching with configurable tolerance
  - Approximate amount matching with percentage-based tolerance
  - Vendor name matching with text similarity algorithms
  - Content-based matching using extracted receipt text
- Matching parameter optimization is implemented:
  - Configurable matching thresholds
  - Weighting system for different matching criteria
  - Confidence scoring for match quality
- Multi-stage matching pipeline is created:
  - Primary matching based on exact criteria
  - Secondary matching based on fuzzy criteria
  - Fallback matching for edge cases
- Matching conflict resolution is implemented:
  - Handling multiple receipt candidates for a transaction
  - Handling multiple transaction candidates for a receipt
  - Prioritization rules for ambiguous matches
- Matching performance metrics and monitoring are implemented
- A/B testing framework for matching improvements is created
- Matching accuracy improvement of at least 20% compared to baseline
- Unit tests for matching algorithm improvements are created
- Documentation for the matching algorithm refinements is created

## Dependencies

- PBI-1-2: Storage Integration and OCR Processing
- PBI-1-3: Basic freee API Integration
- PBI-4-2: OCR Accuracy Improvement

## Estimate

8 story points (approximately 3-4 days)

## Priority

Medium - Important for system reliability but builds on existing functionality
