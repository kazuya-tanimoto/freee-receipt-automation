# PBI-5-1: User Correction Data Collection Features

## Description
Implement features to collect and store user correction data from manual adjustments to receipt-transaction matching. This data will be used to automatically generate rules and improve the matching system over time. This includes creating data collection mechanisms, storage structures, and analysis tools.

## Acceptance Criteria
- User correction data collection system is implemented:
  - Capture all manual matching adjustments
  - Record metadata about corrections (user, timestamp, original match)
  - Store before/after states for each correction
- Correction data categorization is implemented:
  - Classify correction types (date adjustment, amount adjustment, etc.)
  - Identify patterns in corrections
  - Tag corrections with relevant attributes
- Correction data storage is implemented:
  - Database schema for correction data
  - Efficient querying capabilities
  - Data retention policies
- Correction data analysis tools are created:
  - Statistical analysis of correction patterns
  - Visualization of correction trends
  - Identification of common correction scenarios
- Privacy and data protection measures are implemented
- Integration with the manual adjustment interface
- Unit tests for data collection features are created
- Documentation for the correction data collection system is created

## Dependencies
- PBI-3-3: Manual Adjustment Features
- PBI-1-1: Supabase Project Setup

## Estimate
5 story points (approximately 2-3 days)

## Priority
Low - Advanced feature that depends on core functionality
