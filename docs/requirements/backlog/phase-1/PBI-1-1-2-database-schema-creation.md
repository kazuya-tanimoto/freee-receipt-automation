# PBI-1-1-2: Database Schema Creation (SPLIT INTO SUB-TASKS)

## Description
**NOTE: This PBI has been split into smaller, more manageable tasks for AI-driven development.**

Original task was too complex (2 SP with 4 tables + RLS + TypeScript types). Now split into:

## Sub-Tasks
- **PBI-1-1-2-A**: Core Tables Creation (1 SP) - user_settings, receipts tables
- **PBI-1-1-2-B**: Transaction Tables Creation (1 SP) - transactions, processing_logs tables  
- **PBI-1-1-2-C**: RLS and Types Setup (1 SP) - Row Level Security policies + TypeScript types

## Implementation Notes
Refer to the individual sub-task files for detailed implementation:
1. `PBI-1-1-2-A-core-tables-creation.md`
2. `PBI-1-1-2-B-transaction-tables-creation.md`
3. `PBI-1-1-2-C-rls-and-types-setup.md` (to be created)

## Dependencies
- **Required**: PBI-1-1-1 - Supabase project must be initialized

## Total Estimate
3 story points (1 SP each for A, B, C)

## Priority
High - Core data structure needed by all other features
