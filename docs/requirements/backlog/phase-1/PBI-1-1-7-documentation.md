# PBI-1-1-7: Documentation

## Description

Create comprehensive documentation for the Supabase setup phase. This includes setup guides, architecture decisions,
troubleshooting guides, and updating the main README with relevant information.

## Implementation Details

### Files to Create/Modify

1. `docs/setup/supabase-setup.md` - Detailed Supabase setup guide
2. `docs/architecture/decisions/001-supabase-selection.md` - ADR for Supabase
3. `docs/troubleshooting/supabase-issues.md` - Common issues and solutions
4. `README.md` - Update with setup instructions
5. `docs/api/authentication.md` - Authentication API documentation
6. `docs/database/schema-design.md` - Database design documentation

### Technical Requirements

- Use Markdown for all documentation
- Include code examples and commands
- Provide visual diagrams where helpful
- Follow documentation standards in `docs/standards/documentation.md`
- Include links to relevant external documentation

### Documentation Sections

#### Supabase Setup Guide

- Prerequisites and requirements
- Step-by-step setup instructions
- Environment variable configuration
- Local development setup
- Production deployment guide

#### Architecture Decision Record

- Context and problem statement
- Decision drivers
- Considered options
- Decision outcome
- Consequences

#### Troubleshooting Guide

- Common connection issues

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Setup guide allows new developers to onboard quickly
- [ ] Architecture decisions are clearly documented
- [ ] Troubleshooting guide covers common issues
- [ ] README accurately reflects current setup
- [ ] All documentation is reviewed for accuracy

## Dependencies

- **Required**: PBI-1-1-1 through PBI-1-1-6 - Documentation reflects implemented features

## Testing Requirements

- Manual testing: Follow setup guide on clean environment
- Review: Technical review by team members
- Validation: Ensure all commands and code examples work

## Estimate

1 story point

## Priority

Medium - Important for team onboarding but not blocking features

## Implementation Notes

- Include screenshots where helpful
- Test all commands before documenting
- Keep documentation up-to-date with changes
- Consider using Mermaid for diagrams
