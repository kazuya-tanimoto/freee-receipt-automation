# PBI-2-4-4: File Management Testing and Documentation

## Description

Create comprehensive testing suite and documentation for file management features
including naming, folder structure, and duplicate handling.
This ensures reliable file organization and provides clear guidance for users and developers
on file management workflows.

## Implementation Details

### Files to Create/Modify

1. `tests/file-management/unit/` - Unit test files for file management modules
2. `tests/file-management/integration/` - Integration tests with Drive and storage
3. `tests/file-management/e2e/` - End-to-end file organization scenarios
4. `tests/file-management/mocks/` - Mock data and file samples
5. `docs/user/file-organization.md` - User guide for file organization
6. `docs/developer/file-management-api.md` - Developer API documentation
7. `docs/troubleshooting/file-issues.md` - Common file management issues

### Technical Requirements

- Achieve 90%+ test coverage for file management modules
- Test various file types and naming scenarios
- Mock file operations for reliable testing
- Create realistic test data for organization workflows
- Document file naming conventions and folder structure
