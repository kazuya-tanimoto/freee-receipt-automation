# PBI-2-4-1: File Naming System

## Description

Implement a standardized file naming system for receipts that incorporates date, vendor,
and content information. This ensures consistent file organization and enables
efficient searching and sorting of receipt files.

## Implementation Details

### Files to Create/Modify

1. `src/lib/file-management/naming-strategy.ts` - Core naming logic
2. `src/lib/file-management/vendor-detector.ts` - Vendor name extraction
3. `src/lib/file-management/date-formatter.ts` - Date formatting utilities
4. `src/config/naming-rules.ts` - Naming convention configuration
5. `src/lib/file-management/name-sanitizer.ts` - File name sanitization
6. `docs/file-management/naming-conventions.md` - Naming documentation

### Technical Requirements

- Generate consistent file names from receipt data
- Support Japanese and English vendor names
- Handle special characters and length limits
- Ensure unique names to prevent collisions
- Maintain sortable date prefix format

### Implementation Code

See [implementation/PBI-2-4-1-file-naming-implementation.md](implementation/PBI-2-4-1-file-naming-implementation.md) for:

- File naming strategy implementation
- Vendor detection logic
- Date formatting utilities
- Name sanitization rules
