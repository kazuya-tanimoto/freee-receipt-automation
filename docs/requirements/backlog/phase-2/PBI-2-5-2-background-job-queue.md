# PBI-2-5-2: Background Job Queue Implementation

## Description

Implement a robust background job queue system for processing receipts asynchronously. This includes creating a queue
management system with retry logic, priority handling, and resource optimization to handle various processing tasks
efficiently.

## Implementation Details

### Files to Create/Modify

1. `src/lib/queue/types.ts` - Queue and job type definitions
2. `src/lib/queue/job-queue.ts` - Core queue implementation
3. `src/lib/queue/job-processor.ts` - Job processing logic
4. `src/lib/queue/retry-policy.ts` - Retry strategy implementation
5. `src/lib/queue/job-handlers/` - Individual job handlers
6. `supabase/migrations/009_create_job_queue_tables.sql` - Queue tables
7. `src/lib/queue/queue-monitor.ts` - Queue monitoring utilities

### Technical Requirements

- Implement database-backed job queue with priority support
- Create retry mechanism with exponential backoff
- Support for different job types (email, OCR, matching, etc.)
- Concurrent job processing with configurable workers
- Dead letter queue for failed jobs
- Resource usage monitoring and throttling

### Implementation Code

- Database schema
- Core queue implementation
- Job processor and worker implementation
- Retry policy implementation
- Interface specifications

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Job queue tables are created with proper indexes
- [ ] Jobs can be enqueued with priority and scheduling
- [ ] Workers can process jobs concurrently
- [ ] Failed jobs are retried with exponential backoff
- [ ] Dead letter queue captures permanently failed jobs
- [ ] Queue monitoring provides real-time statistics

### Verification Commands

```bash
# Check queue status
npm run queue:status
# Process jobs manually
npm run queue:process
# Check dead letter queue
npm run queue:dead-letter
# Run queue tests
npm test -- queue
```

## Dependencies

- **Required**: PBI-2-5-1 - pg_cron setup for job scheduling
- **Required**: Database infrastructure

## Testing Requirements

- Unit tests: Queue operations with mocked database
- Integration tests: Multi-worker processing scenarios
- Performance tests: Queue throughput under load
- Stress tests: Handling worker failures and recovery

## Estimate

2 story points

## Priority

High - Core infrastructure for asynchronous processing

## Implementation Notes

- Consider using Redis for higher performance if needed
- Monitor queue depth and processing latency
- Implement circuit breaker for external service calls
- Add metrics for job processing time and success rates
- Consider implementing job priorities dynamically based on user tier
