# PBI-2-3-4: Google Drive Error Handling and Retry Logic

## Description

Implement comprehensive error handling and retry mechanisms for Google Drive API operations. This ensures robust
operation under various failure conditions including API rate limits, storage quota issues, network problems, and
temporary service unavailability.

## Implementation Details

### Files to Create/Modify

1. `src/lib/drive/error-handler.ts` - Drive-specific error handling
2. `src/lib/drive/retry-strategy.ts` - Retry logic implementation
3. `src/lib/drive/circuit-breaker.ts` - Circuit breaker for Drive API
4. `src/lib/drive/quota-manager.ts` - Drive quota monitoring and management
5. `src/lib/common/drive-errors.ts` - Drive error classification
6. `docs/drive/error-handling.md` - Error handling documentation

### Technical Requirements

- Handle Drive API rate limiting and quotas
- Implement exponential backoff for transient failures
- Monitor storage quota usage and warnings
- Classify errors as retryable vs. non-retryable
- Provide detailed error reporting and recovery suggestions

- Drive-specific error classification
- Retry strategy implementation
- Circuit breaker pattern
- Quota management
- Error monitoring and reporting

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Drive API errors are properly classified
- [ ] Retry logic works for transient failures
- [ ] Circuit breaker prevents API overload
- [ ] Quota usage is monitored and reported
- [ ] Error recovery is automatic where possible
- [ ] User receives clear error messages

## Dependencies

- **Required**: PBI-2-3-1 - Drive OAuth setup
- **Required**: PBI-2-3-2 - Drive basic API operations

## Testing Requirements

- Unit tests: Error classification logic
- Integration tests: Retry behavior with mock errors
- Load tests: Circuit breaker activation
- Stress tests: Quota limit handling

## Estimate

2 story points

## Priority

High - Essential for reliable Drive operations
