# PBI-2-2-3: Gmail Business Logic Integration

## Description

Integrate Gmail operations with the core business logic for receipt processing workflow. This includes email search for
receipts, attachment extraction, metadata parsing, and coordination with OCR processing to create a seamless
email-to-receipt pipeline.

## Implementation Details

### Files to Create/Modify

1. `src/services/gmail-receipt-processor.ts` - Main email processing service
2. `src/lib/gmail/receipt-finder.ts` - Receipt email identification
3. `src/lib/gmail/attachment-handler.ts` - Attachment extraction logic
4. `src/lib/gmail/email-parser.ts` - Email content parsing
5. `src/services/gmail-workflow.ts` - Complete Gmail workflow
6. `docs/gmail/business-logic.md` - Business logic documentation

### Technical Requirements

- Search emails for receipt patterns
- Extract PDF and image attachments
- Parse email metadata for receipt info
- Queue attachments for OCR processing
- Mark processed emails to avoid duplicates

### Implementation Code

- Receipt email identification logic
- Attachment extraction implementation
- Email parsing utilities
- Workflow orchestration
- Processing state management
