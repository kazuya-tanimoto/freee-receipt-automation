# PBI-2-3-2: Google Drive Basic API Operations

## Description

Implement core Google Drive API operations including file upload, download, search,
folder management, and metadata operations. This provides the foundation for all
Drive-related functionality in the application.

## Implementation Details

### Files to Create/Modify

1. `src/lib/drive/client.ts` - Drive API client wrapper
2. `src/lib/drive/operations.ts` - Core Drive operations
3. `src/lib/drive/search.ts` - Drive search functionality
4. `src/lib/drive/metadata.ts` - File metadata operations
5. `src/lib/drive/types.ts` - TypeScript types for Drive
6. `src/lib/drive/constants.ts` - Drive-related constants

### Technical Requirements

- Initialize Drive API client with proper scopes
- Implement file upload with resume capability
- Support folder creation and navigation
- Enable file search with custom queries
- Handle file metadata and custom properties

### Implementation Code
