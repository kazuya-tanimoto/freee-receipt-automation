# PBI-2-4-3: Duplicate Handling Logic

## Description

Implement comprehensive duplicate file detection and handling logic to prevent file conflicts and manage similar
receipts. This includes filename collision resolution, content-based duplicate detection, and intelligent merging
strategies for handling multiple versions of the same receipt.

## Implementation Details

### Files to Create/Modify

1. `src/lib/file-management/duplicate-detector.ts` - Duplicate detection logic
2. `src/lib/file-management/conflict-resolver.ts` - Filename conflict resolution
3. `src/lib/file-management/content-comparison.ts` - Content-based duplicate detection
4. `src/lib/file-management/merge-strategy.ts` - Duplicate merge strategies
5. `src/services/duplicate-cleanup.ts` - Background duplicate cleanup
6. `docs/file-management/duplicate-handling.md` - Duplicate handling documentation

### Technical Requirements

- Detect filename collisions and resolve automatically
- Identify content-based duplicates using file hashing
- Support multiple resolution strategies (rename, merge, skip)
- Handle partial duplicates and similar receipts
- Provide user-configurable duplicate policies

### Implementation Code

- Filename collision resolution implementation
- Content-based duplicate detection
- Hash-based comparison logic
- Duplicate merge strategies
- Background cleanup service
