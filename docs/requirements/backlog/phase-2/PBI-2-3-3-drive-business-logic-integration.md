# PBI-2-3-3: Google Drive Business Logic Integration

## Description

Integrate Google Drive operations with the core business logic for receipt processing workflow.
This includes file organization based on transaction data, integration with OCR results,
and coordination with freee API data to maintain proper file associations.

## Implementation Details

### Files to Create/Modify

1. `src/services/drive-receipt-organizer.ts` - Main organization service
2. `src/lib/drive/file-metadata.ts` - Custom properties for receipts
3. `src/lib/drive/transaction-linker.ts` - Link files to transactions
4. `src/services/drive-workflow.ts` - Complete Drive workflow
5. `src/lib/drive/search-utilities.ts` - Advanced search functionality
6. `docs/drive/business-logic.md` - Business logic documentation

### Technical Requirements

- Organize files based on receipt metadata
- Store transaction IDs in file properties
- Support file search by multiple criteria
- Maintain file-transaction relationships
- Handle file movement between folders
