# PBI-2-5-1: pg_cron Setup and Schedule Job Foundation

## Description

Set up PostgreSQL cron extension (pg_cron) for scheduled task execution within Supabase.
This includes creating the foundation for automated receipt processing, implementing
basic scheduling patterns, and establishing monitoring for scheduled jobs.

## Implementation Details

### Files to Create/Modify

1. `supabase/migrations/008_enable_pg_cron.sql` - Enable pg_cron extension
2. `supabase/migrations/009_create_scheduled_jobs.sql` - Schedule job tables
3. `src/lib/cron/job-scheduler.ts` - Job scheduling utilities
4. `src/lib/cron/cron-patterns.ts` - Common cron patterns
5. `src/services/scheduled-processor.ts` - Scheduled processing service
6. `docs/cron/scheduling-guide.md` - Scheduling documentation

### Technical Requirements

- Enable pg_cron extension in Supabase
- Create scheduled job configuration tables
- Implement common scheduling patterns
- Monitor job execution status
- Handle timezone considerations (JST)

### Implementation Code

- Database schema for scheduled jobs
- pg_cron configuration
- Job scheduling utilities
- Monitoring queries
- Common cron patterns
