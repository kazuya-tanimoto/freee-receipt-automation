# PBI-3-2-1: Dashboard Statistics Overview

## Description

Create the main dashboard page with key statistics cards showing receipt processing metrics,
transaction matching rates, and system performance indicators.

## Implementation Details

### Files to Create/Modify

1. `src/app/(dashboard)/page.tsx` - Main dashboard page
2. `src/components/dashboard/StatsOverview.tsx` - Statistics cards container
3. `src/components/dashboard/StatCard.tsx` - Individual statistic card
4. `src/lib/dashboard/stats.ts` - Statistics calculation functions
5. `src/hooks/useDashboardStats.ts` - Statistics data fetching hook
6. `src/components/ui/skeleton.tsx` - Loading skeleton component

### Technical Requirements

- Real-time statistics from Supabase with automatic updates
- Percentage change calculations and trend indicators
- Loading states with skeleton UI
- Error handling for data fetching failures
- Responsive grid layout for statistics cards
- Performance optimization for large datasets

### Database Queries

```sql
-- Receipt processing statistics
SELECT
  COUNT(*) as total_receipts,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN status = 'processed' THEN 1 END) as processed_receipts,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN status = 'pending' THEN 1 END) as pending_receipts,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN created_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL '24 hours' THEN 1 END) as today_receipts
FROM receipts
WHERE created_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days';

-- Transaction matching statistics
SELECT
  COUNT(*) as total_matches,
  AVG(match_confidence) as avg_confidence,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN match_confidence > 0.8 THEN 1 END) as high_confidence_matches
FROM receipt_transactions;
```

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Dashboard displays accurate receipt processing statistics
- [ ] Transaction matching metrics are calculated correctly
- [ ] Statistics cards show percentage changes from previous period
- [ ] Loading states display while fetching data
- [ ] Error states handle network failures gracefully
- [ ] Statistics update automatically when new data is available
- [ ] Cards are responsive and accessible

### Verification Commands

```bash
npm run test:dashboard
npm run test:stats
npm run test:responsive
```

## Dependencies

- **Required**: PBI-3-1-5 - Application layout (dashboard container)
- **Required**: PBI-3-1-2 - Supabase client (data fetching)
- **Required**: Phase 1 - Receipt and transaction database schema

## Testing Requirements

- Data accuracy: Verify statistics calculations are correct
- Real-time updates: Test automatic data refresh
- Performance: Test with large datasets (10,000+ records)

## Estimate

1 story point

## Priority

High - Primary interface for system monitoring

## Implementation Notes

- Use React Query for efficient data caching and updates
- Implement proper loading skeletons that match final content
- Calculate percentage changes using previous period data
- Consider implementing customizable time ranges for statistics
- Add proper error boundaries for graceful failure handling
