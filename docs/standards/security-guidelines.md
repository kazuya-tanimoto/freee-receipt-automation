## 1. Handling of Confidential Information

### 1.1 Definition of Confidential Information

- API Keys
- Passwords
- Personal Information
- Access Tokens
- Environment Variables

### 1.2 Storage of Confidential Information

- Manage as environment variables
- Use encrypted configuration files
- Exclude from version control
- Use secrets management service (e.g., GitHub Secrets)

### 1.3 Sharing of Confidential Information

- Use secure channels
- Use temporary access tokens
- Regular rotation
- Implement access logging

## 2. Access Control

### 2.1 Authentication

- Use multi-factor authentication
- Strong password policy
- Session management
- Implement rate limiting

### 2.2 Authorization

- Principle of least privilege
- Role-based access control
- Regular permission review
- Implement IP-based restrictions where appropriate

## 3. Data Protection

### 3.1 Data Encryption

- Encryption in transit (TLS 1.3)
- Encryption at rest
- Key management
- Regular key rotation

### 3.2 Data Backup

- Regular backups
- Encrypted backups
- Backup verification
- Off-site backup storage

## 4. Security Audit

### 4.1 Audit Logs

- Access log recording
- Change history tracking
- Log retention period
- Centralized log management

### 4.2 Security Testing

- Regular vulnerability scanning
- Penetration testing
- Code security review
- Automated security testing in CI/CD

## 5. Vulnerability Disclosure

### 5.1 Reporting Process

- Use security@${ORG_DOMAIN} for vulnerability reports
- Acknowledge receipt within 48 hours
- Provide regular updates on progress
- Maintain confidentiality of reports

### 5.2 Response Timeline

- Critical vulnerabilities: 24 hours
- High severity: 72 hours
- Medium severity: 1 week
- Low severity: 2 weeks

## 6. Dependency Management

### 6.1 SBOM Generation

- Generate Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) using `cyclonedx`
- Store SBOM in `/docs/standards/sbom/`
- Update SBOM on dependency changes
- Include license information

### 6.2 Dependency Scanning

- Weekly automated dependency scanning
- Use GitHub Dependabot
- Regular manual review of dependencies
- Document known vulnerabilities
