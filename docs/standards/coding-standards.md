# Coding Standards

## Overview
This document defines the standards for maintaining code quality in the project.

## Code Style

### 1. Naming Conventions
- Variable names: camelCase (e.g., `userName`)
- Function names: camelCase (e.g., `getUserData`)
- Class names: PascalCase (e.g., `UserService`)
- Constants: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE (e.g., `MAX_RETRY_COUNT`)

### 2. File Structure
- Line count limits per file:
  - Basic limit: 150 lines
  - Absolute limit: 250 lines
  - If exceeding 150 lines, the following actions must be taken:
    - Split functionality (divide into multiple files)
    - Extract common processes
    - Separate utility functions
  - If exceeding 250 lines, code redesign is required
- Exceptions where exceeding 250 lines is allowed:
  - Test files (when there are many test cases)
  - Data structure or type definition files
  - Auto-generated code (only if the following conditions are met):
    - Generated code must be split if possible
    - Each part of generated code must be within 150 lines
    - Each part must have a single responsibility
    - Generated code must be properly documented

### 3. AI Agent Code Generation
- Code generated by AI agents must be kept within 150 lines
- If exceeding 150 lines, split according to the following criteria:
  - Split by functionality
  - Each part must be within 150 lines
  - Each part must have a single responsibility
  - Purpose and behavior of each part must be clearly explained
- Quality checks for generated code:
  - Conduct code review
  - Ensure test coverage
  - Verify performance and security
  - Confirm compliance with line count limits

### 3. Comment Standards
- Function descriptions: JSDoc format
- Complex logic: Inline comments
- TODO comments: Include deadline and assignee

## Code Quality

### 1. Testing
- Unit test coverage: 80% or higher
- Test file naming: `*.test.ts`
- Mock usage: Properly mock external dependencies

### 2. Error Handling
- Exception handling: Specify concrete exception types
- Error messages: User-friendly
- Logging: Use appropriate log levels

### 3. Performance
- Asynchronous processing: Proper use of Promise/async-await
- Memory management: Release unnecessary references
- Database queries: Utilize indexes

## Security

### 1. Input Validation
- User input: Appropriate validation
- SQL injection prevention: Parameterized queries
- XSS prevention: Escape processing

### 2. Authentication & Authorization
- Passwords: Hashing
- Session management: Appropriate timeouts
- Access control: Principle of least privilege
