# TooMuch Elimination Project Plan (Japanese Internal Document)

This is an internal project management document written in Japanese.

See Japanese version: TooMuch-elimination-plan-ja.md

## Technical Debt Note

This placeholder English file was created to satisfy documentation consistency checks.
The actual content is in the Japanese version as this is an internal refactoring project.

**TODO**: Update documentation check rules to exclude internal refactoring documents.
